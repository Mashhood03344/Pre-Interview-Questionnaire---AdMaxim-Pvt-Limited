Multi-Stage Build:**</p><p></p><p>`    `**Stage 1: Build Stage (Maven + Git):**</p><p>`        `The first stage uses the maven:3.8-openjdk-11-slim image for building the application. This stage includes all the tools needed for the build process (Maven, Git, etc.), but these tools are not needed in the final runtime image. By separating the build process from the runtime environment, unnecessary tools do not end up in the final image.</p><p>`    `**Stage 2: Runtime Stage (Tomcat):**</p><p>`        `The second stage uses the tomcat:9-alpine image, which is a much smaller, lightweight version of Tomcat (based on Alpine Linux). This image includes only the Tomcat server and necessary components for running the application. The build tools like Maven and Git are excluded from this stage, keeping the final image smaller.</p><p></p><p>**2. Cleaning Up After Git Installation:**</p><p></p><p>`    `After installing Git in the build stage, the following command is used to clean up unnecessary files:<br><br>` `apt-get clean   <br><br>` `This removes any temporary files created during the installation process, further reducing the image size.</p><p></p><p>**3. Removing the Maven Cache:**</p><p></p><p>`    `After building the project with Maven, the Dockerfile removes the Maven local repository to reduce the final image size:</p><p></p><p>rm -rf ~/.m2/repository</p><p><h3></h3></p><p>This step is important because Maven caches downloaded dependencies in the local repository. While this helps speed up future builds, it is not required for running the application. Removing it from the final image reduces unnecessary bloat.</p><p></p><p>**4. Optimized Copying:**</p><p></p><p>`    `The Dockerfile uses the COPY command efficiently:</p><p></p><p>COPY --from=builder /app/target/app-java-1.0.0.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war</p><p></p><p>This ensures that only the necessary WAR file is copied into the final image, and no other build-related files (such as source code or build dependencies) are included in the final runtime image.</p><p></p><p><h2><a name="_toc183788056"></a>Question 2</h2></p><p></p><p>Using your custom Docker image (refer to the previous question), create a Kubernetes deployment file to deploy the application. The deployment should use a ReplicaSet of 3 and expose the application via a LoadBalancer service.</p><p><h3></h3><br></h3><br>**<a name="_toc183788057"></a>**Deployment.yaml and Service.yaml Files</h3></p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788058"></a>Deployment.yaml</h3></p><p></p><p>apiVersion: apps/v1</p><p>kind: Deployment</p><p>metadata:</p><p>`  `name: java-tomcat-app-deployment</p><p>spec:</p><p>`  `replicas: 3</p><p>`  `selector:</p><p>`    `matchLabels:</p><p>`      `app: java-tomcat-app</p><p>`  `template:</p><p>`    `metadata:</p><p>`      `labels:</p><p>`        `app: java-tomcat-app</p><p>`    `spec:</p><p>`      `containers:</p><p>`        `- name: java-tomcat-app</p><p>`          `image: mashhood03344/java-tomcat-app:latest   # Docker image from Docker Hub</p><p>`          `ports:</p><p>`            `- containerPort: 8080   # Expose port 8080 from the container</p><p>---</p><p>apiVersion: apps/v1</p><p>kind: ReplicaSet</p><p>metadata:</p><p>`  `name: java-tomcat-app-replicaset</p><p>spec:</p><p>`  `replicas: 3</p><p>`  `selector:</p><p>`    `matchLabels:</p><p>`      `app: java-tomcat-app</p><p>`  `template:</p><p>`    `metadata:</p><p>`      `labels:</p><p>`        `app: java-tomcat-app</p><p>`    `spec:</p><p>`      `containers:</p><p>`        `- name: java-tomcat-app</p><p>`          `image: mashhood03344/java-tomcat-app:latest   # Docker image from Docker Hub</p><p>`          `ports:</p><p>`            `- containerPort: 8080</p><p></p><p><h2></h2></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788059"></a>service.yaml</h3></p><p></p><p>apiVersion: v1</p><p>kind: Service</p><p>metadata:</p><p>`  `name: java-tomcat-app-service</p><p>spec:</p><p>`  `selector:</p><p>`    `app: java-tomcat-app  # Matches the app label from the deployment</p><p>`  `ports:</p><p>`    `- protocol: TCP</p><p>`      `port: 80      # Exposed port on the LoadBalancer</p><p>`      `targetPort: 8080   # The port on the container (Tomcat default)</p><p>`  `type: LoadBalancer   # Exposes the service externally</p><p></p><p><h2></h2></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788060"></a>Command to apply the deployment and the service</h3></p><p></p><p>kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml</p><p>kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml</p><p></p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788061"></a>Command to see all the pods in the cluster</h3></p><p></p><p>kubectl get pods</p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788062"></a>Command to see all the services in the cluster</h3></p><p></p><p>kubectl get services</p><p></p><p><a name="_toc183788063"></a>Command to see the IP address of the Load Balancer <br><br>` `Once the LoadBalancer is set up, you should be able to access your application via the external IP address provided by the LoadBalancer.</p><p>You can get the external IP using:</p><p></p><p>kubectl get svc java-tomcat-app-service</p><p></p><p>Look under the EXTERNAL-IP column to find the IP address of the LoadBalancer.</p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788064"></a>Command to delete Deployment and service</h3></p><p></p><p>**To delete Deployment**</p><p></p><p>kubectl delete deployment deployment.yaml</p><p></p><p>**To delete Service**</p><p></p><p>kubectl delete service service.yaml</p><p></p><p><h2><a name="_toc183788065"></a>Question 3 </h2></p><p></p><p>**You are tasked with setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets for deploy ec2 instance in both subnets.  Explain what a Bastion Host is and its role in this setup.**</p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788066"></a>Bastion Host</h3></p><p>A **Bastion Host** (sometimes called a **Jump Host**) is a special-purpose server used to securely access resources in a private network or subnet that cannot be accessed directly from the internet. It acts as a bridge or intermediary between the external world (public internet) and the internal network (private subnets) by allowing secure access to instances in the private subnets. In a typical setup with public and private subnets, the Bastion Host serves as the access point for administrators or users who need to manage or interact with instances in the private subnet.</p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788067"></a>Role of the Bastion Host in a VPC Setup</h3></p><p>In a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both **public** and **private subnets**, the Bastion Host is deployed in the **public subnet** to facilitate secure SSH or RDP access to EC2 instances in the **private subnet**.</p><p>Here’s how the Bastion Host fits into the setup:</p><p>1. **Access to Private Instances**:</p><p>- EC2 instances in private subnets cannot have direct access from the internet for security reasons. They are isolated from the public internet.</p><p>- The Bastion Host in the public subnet provides a secure entry point. Admins or authorized users can SSH into the Bastion Host (which is publicly accessible) and from there, they can SSH into instances in the private subnet.</p><p>2. **Security Considerations**:</p><p>- **Access Control**: The Bastion Host is typically hardened and tightly controlled. Access is granted based on SSH keys or other secure methods, ensuring that only authorized users can access it.</p><p>- **Minimal Attack Surface**: The Bastion Host is the only instance that has inbound internet traffic (usually limited to SSH or RDP), which minimizes the attack surface of the private network.</p><p>- **Audit and Monitoring**: The Bastion Host can be used for logging and monitoring all access to private instances, which helps in auditing and detecting any suspicious activities.</p><p>3. **Networking Setup**:</p><p>- The **public subnet** contains the Bastion Host, which is assigned a **public IP** to be accessible from the internet.</p><p>- The **private subnet** contains the EC2 instances that need to be accessed securely. These instances do not have public IP addresses and can only communicate with the Bastion Host via private IP addresses.</p><p>- The Bastion Host must be configured with appropriate security groups to allow SSH or RDP access from trusted IP addresses (typically your office or VPN).</p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788068"></a>How the Bastion Host Works in This Setup</h3></p><p>1. **SSH or RDP Connection to Bastion Host**:</p><p>- First, the user connects to the Bastion Host over the internet using SSH (for Linux) or RDP (for Windows). The Bastion Host should only allow inbound connections on ports such as 22 (SSH) or 3389 (RDP) from trusted IPs.</p><p>2. **SSH Connection from Bastion Host to Private Instances**:</p><p>- After logging into the Bastion Host, the user can SSH into the EC2 instances in the private subnet using the **private IP** of the instances.</p><p>- The private instances don’t have direct public internet access, but by hopping through the Bastion Host, users can securely manage those instances.</p><p>3. **Security Group Setup**:</p><p>- The Bastion Host has a security group that allows inbound access on the required ports (e.g., port 22 for SSH or port 3389 for RDP) only from trusted IP addresses (such as the user's home office IP, VPN, or corporate network).</p><p>- The EC2 instances in the private subnet have security groups that only allow inbound connections from the Bastion Host’s private IP address, preventing direct access from the public internet.</p><p><h3></h3></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788069"></a>Example Use Case</h3></p><p>1. **Public Subnet**: Contains the Bastion Host (EC2 instance with a public IP).</p><p>2. **Private Subnet**: Contains EC2 instances that only have private IPs and cannot be accessed directly from the internet.</p><p>3. **Access Flow**:</p><p>- User connects to the Bastion Host via SSH (using the public IP of the Bastion Host).</p><p>- From the Bastion Host, the user can SSH to the private instances using their private IPs.</p><p>This setup ensures that sensitive infrastructure in private subnets is protected, while still allowing necessary administrative access via the Bastion Host.</p><p></p><p><h3></h3></p><p><a name="_toc183788070"></a>Question 4<br><br>**Write a shell script that processes a log file (/var/log/app.log) and outputs a summary of the number of occurrences of each error type (e.g., "ERROR", "WARN", "INFO") in the log.

|<p><h3></h3></p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788075"></a>What is Amazon S3?</h3></p><p></p><p>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service offered by AWS that provides highly scalable, durable, and low-latency storage for a variety of data types. S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is commonly used for backup and restore, archiving, big data analytics, disaster recovery, content distribution, and more.</p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788076"></a>Key Features of Amazon S3</h3></p><p></p><p>- **Scalability:** S3 scales automatically to handle an infinite amount of data and storage needs. You can store virtually any amount of data without worrying about capacity planning.</p><p></p><p>- **Durability:** S3 provides 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability over a given year, ensuring your data is safe from loss.</p><p></p><p>- **High Availability:** S3 is designed to deliver 99.99% availability over a given year, meaning your data will always be available when needed.</p><p></p><p>- **Security:** S3 integrates with AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management), enabling you to control access to your data through policies, bucket ACLs, and encryption.</p><p></p><p>- **Storage Classes:** S3 offers different storage classes such as Standard, Infrequent Access (IA), One Zone-IA, and Glacier to optimize costs based on data access patterns.</p><p></p><p>- **Versioning:** S3 supports versioning of objects, allowing you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object in a bucket.</p><p></p><p>- **Lifecycle Policies:** S3 allows you to set rules that automate the transition of objects between storage classes or delete them after a specified time.</p><p></p><p>- **Access Control:** S3 allows fine-grained control over who can access and perform actions on your data using IAM policies, ACLs, and bucket policies.</p><p></p><p>- **Event Notifications:** S3 can trigger notifications when certain events occur (e.g., an object is uploaded, deleted, etc.) to other AWS services like Lambda, SNS, or SQS.</p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788077"></a>Securing Sensitive Data Stored in Amazon S3</h3></p><p></p><p>There are several strategies and AWS features available to ensure sensitive data stored in S3 is protected from unauthorized access:</p><p>1\**. Use Encryption**</p><p>- **Server-Side Encryption (SSE):**</p><p>&emsp;</p><p>&emsp;**SSE-S3:** S3 automatically encrypts your data using AES-256 when uploading and decrypts when downloading (no management required).</p><p>&emsp;</p><p>&emsp;**SSE-KMS:** Uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys, providing more control over key management, auditing, and permissions.</p><p>&emsp;</p><p>&emsp;**SSE-C:** Allows you to manage your own encryption keys. S3 will use the provided key to encrypt/decrypt data.</p><p>&emsp;</p><p>- **Client-Side Encryption:** Encrypt the data before uploading to S3. This ensures the data is encrypted on the client side before it reaches S3.</p><p></p><p>2\. **Enable Bucket Versioning**</p><p></p><p>`    `Enable versioning in the bucket to keep multiple versions of your data, allowing you to restore earlier versions of an object. This can be crucial in recovering from accidental deletions or overwrites.</p><p></p><p>3\**. Use Bucket Policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs)**</p><p></p><p>`    `**Bucket Policies:** Use bucket policies to specify who can access the bucket and the actions they can perform. Policies are JSON documents that allow you to define permissions based on factors like IP address, time, and request origin.</p><p></p><p>`    `**ACLs (Access Control Lists):** Use ACLs to grant access to specific AWS accounts or users for individual objects. ACLs allow you to define read/write permissions on an object level.</p><p></p><p>4\. **Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) Policies**</p><p></p><p>`    `Define detailed IAM policies to control user and service permissions. Ensure only authorized users or services can access your S3 data. Use principles of least privilege when assigning permissions.</p><p></p><p>`    `IAM roles can also be used to allow EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or other AWS services to interact with S3 while maintaining access controls.</p><p></p><p>5\**. Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for Deletions**</p><p></p><p>`    `Protect your S3 buckets from accidental or malicious deletions by requiring MFA for delete operations. You can configure this using MFA Delete, which requires an MFA token to delete objects or versioned data.</p><p></p><p>6\. **Use Access Points for Fine-Grained Access Control**</p><p></p><p>`    `S3 Access Points allow you to create unique access configurations for specific data sets within an S3 bucket. These access points simplify the process of managing access to large datasets or shared buckets, ensuring that only the right users and applications have the correct permissions.</p><p></p><p>7\. **Enable Logging and Monitoring**</p><p></p><p>`    `**S3 Access Logs:** Enable access logging to capture detailed records of requests made to your bucket, including the IP address, time, request type, and more. You can store these logs in a separate S3 bucket for auditing.</p><p></p><p>`    `**AWS CloudTrail:** Use AWS CloudTrail to log API calls made to S3 and other AWS services. CloudTrail helps track who accessed your S3 resources, when, and what actions were performed.</p><p></p><p>8\**. Use VPC Endpoints for Secure Connections**</p><p></p><p>`    `Use VPC endpoints to securely connect to S3 without exposing your traffic to the public internet. VPC endpoints ensure that data is transferred within AWS’s network, reducing the risk of data interception.</p><p></p><p>9\. **Use S3 Block Public Access**</p><p></p><p>`    `Ensure that your S3 bucket and objects are not publicly accessible by using the S3 Block Public Access feature. This feature blocks public access at both the bucket and account levels, preventing any accidental exposure of sensitive data.</p><p></p><p>10\. **Data Integrity Checks (MD5)**</p><p></p><p>`    `Ensure data integrity by verifying checksums. You can configure S3 to return an MD5 checksum upon data upload. When you download the object, you can validate the integrity by comparing the returned checksum.</p><p></p><p><h3><a name="_toc183788078"></a>Optimizing Cost for Storing Large Amounts of Data</h3></p><p></p><p>To optimize costs while storing large amounts of data in S3, you can consider the following options:</p><p>1\. **Use Storage Classes**</p><p></p><p>`    `**S3 Standard:** Best for frequently accessed data. It's optimized for high durability, availability, and performance.</p><p>`    `**S3 Infrequent Access (IA):** For data that is not accessed frequently but needs to be available quickly when needed. This class is cheaper than the Standard class but incurs retrieval costs.</p><p>`    `**S3 One Zone-IA:** A more cost-effective option than IA, but it stores data in a single availability zone, making it less durable.</p><p>`    `**S3 Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive:** For archiving data that is rarely accessed. Glacier is low-cost storage for archival data with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours, and Glacier Deep Archive is even cheaper with longer retrieval times (up to 12 hours).</p><p></p><p>2\. **Lifecycle Policies**</p><p></p><p>`    `Use lifecycle policies to automatically transition data between storage classes based on age or access patterns. For example, you can move data to Glacier after 30 days of inactivity, or delete data after a certain time.</p><p></p><p>3\**. Data Compression**</p><p></p><p>`    `Compress data before uploading it to S3 to reduce storage costs. S3 does not compress your data by default, so manually compressing large files can significantly reduce storage costs.</p><p></p><p>4\. **Object Expiry**</p><p></p><p>`    `Use object expiration policies to automatically delete objects after a specified period of time. This is particularly useful for logs, temporary files, and other non-essential data.</p><p></p><p>5\. **Optimize Uploads with Multipart Upload**</p><p></p><p>`    `For large objects, use Multipart Uploads to upload parts of an object concurrently, which reduces upload time. It also allows you to upload only the parts of an object that have changed, saving on bandwidth and storage costs.</p>|
